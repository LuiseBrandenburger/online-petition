## Overview
This project was built as my first full stack project during my enrollment at the Spiced Academy Bootcamp. 
So far, the project consists of some very basic features.

## Motivation
I created this project to learn how to build a frontend and connect it with a backend and eventually deploy it on Heroku.

## Tech
This Project was built with JS, Handlebars.js, Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL.
Other Libraries I used:
- cookie session
- bcrypt

## Features
- Users can create a profile or login/logout into their account
- Users can sign or delet their signature from the petition
- Users can add aditional information such as age, city or homepage
- Users can view a list of all signers as soon as they signed the petition
