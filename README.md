## Overview
This project was built as my first full stack project during my enrollment at the Spiced Academy Bootcamp. 
So far, the project consists of some very basic features. With this app you can upload images 
(preferably of the great artist Roger Dean) and comment on existing images.

## Motivation
I created this project to learn how to build a frontend and connect it with a backend and eventually deploy it on Heroku.

## Tech
This Project was built with Vanilla JS, Handlebars, Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL.
Other Libraries I used:
- cookie session

## Features
- Users can create a profile or login/logout into their account
- Users can sign or delet their signature from the petition
- users can add aditional information such as age, city
