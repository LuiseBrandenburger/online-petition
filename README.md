## Overview
This project was built as my first full stack project during my enrollment at the Spiced Academy Bootcamp. 
So far, the project consists of some very basic features. With this app you can upload images 
(preferably of the great artist Roger Dean) and comment on existing images.

## Motivation
I created this project to get to know Vue.js and getting to know state and data flow in a full stack project.

## Tech
This Project was built with Vue.js, Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL.
Other Libraries I used:
- cookie session
- moment
- aws, s3

## Features
- Users can upload files (images)
- Users can add title, description when posting the image
- moments is used to render the timestamp to the comments and image post
- Users can view and add comment on single images

## Future Features
Features I would like to add in the future are:
- infinite scroll
- delete images

## TO DO'S
- testing
